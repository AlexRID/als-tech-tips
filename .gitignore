.gitignore file for a general web project - Bare Minimum Git
 .gitignore
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# .gitignore
# Bare Minimum Git
# http://ironco.de/bare-minimum-git/
# ver 20181206
#
# From the root of your project run
# curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/salcode/10017553/raw/.gitignore
# to download this file
#
# This file is tailored for a general web project, it
# is NOT optimized for a WordPress project.  See
# https://gist.github.com/salcode/b515f520d3f8207ecd04
# for a WordPress specific .gitignore
#
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
# http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
#
# NOTES:
# The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not
# tracked by Git remain untracked.
#
# To ignore uncommitted changes in a file that is already tracked,
# use `git update-index --assume-unchanged`.
#
# To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked,
# use `git rm --cached`
#
# Change Log:
# 20181206 remove trailing whitespaces
# 20180714 unignore .phpcs.xml.dist
# 20170502 unignore composer.lock
# 20170502 ignore components loaded via Bower
# 20150326 ignore jekyll build directory `/_site`
# 20150324 Reorganized file to list ignores first and whitelisted last,
#          change WordPress .gitignore link to preferred gist,
#          add curl line for quick installation
#          ignore composer files (vendor directory and lock file)
# 20140606 Add .editorconfig as a tracked file
# 20140418 remove explicit inclusion
#          of readme.md (this is not an ignored file by default)

Thanks for posting this as I was looking for exactly this gitignore file....switched from native java android coding to web and design and did not have an adequate gitignore setup for web projects
